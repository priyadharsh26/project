Since the dawn of the IPL in 2008, it has attracted viewers all around the globe.
This prediction is usually done with the help of data analytics. Before, when there were no advancements in machine learning, predictions were usually based on intuition or some basic algorithms.
We humans canâ€™t easily identify patterns from huge data and thus here, machine learning and deep learning comes into play. 
It learns how the players and teams have performed against the opposite team previously and trains the model accordingly.
Using only machine learning algorithm gives a moderate accuracy therefore we used deep learning which gives much better performance than our previous model and considers the attributes which can give accurate results.
